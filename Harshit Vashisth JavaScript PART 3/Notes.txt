JavaScript : JS is Synchronous ( line-by-line ) and a single-threaded ( 
             one task at a time ) programming language. But with the help of async-await, set-timeout–set-interval, and promise ( .then .then … ) we can change the default behavior of javascript and make it asynchronous.

Synchronous Programming : Here tasks are executed one after the other in 
                          a sequential manner. Each task must complete before the next one can start.

            Ex: console.log('Hi')
                for(let i=0 ; i<2 ; i++){
                    console.log("Bye");
                }
                console.log("End");

                Output : Hi Bye Bye End

Asynchronous Programming : Here tasks can be started and completed 
                           independently of each other. Instead of waiting for a task to finish before moving on to the next one, the program can continue executing other tasks while waiting for the completion of certain operations
            Ex: console.log("Start");
                setTimeout(() => {
                console.log("Inside setTimeout");
                }, 2000);
                console.log("End");

                Output :Start End Inside setTimeout

Set-Timeout

    *   setTimeout is a browser functionality
    *   The Call-back in setTimeout will run only after all the execution of 
        other sync code has been done.
    *   The setTimeout function in JavaScript returns an ID that can be used 
        to cancel the timeout before it executes.

                const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
                console.log('Timeout executed!');
                }, 2000);
                It returns an ID, which is stored in the timeoutId variable.

            If you want to cancel the timeout before it executes, you can use the clearTimeout function and pass in the ID returned by setTimeout and then the setTimeout function will not execute. 
            
                clearTimeout(timeoutId);

            It's important to note that the ID returned by setTimeout is UNIQUE for each timeout, so if you have multiple timeouts, you need to store their respective IDs if you want to cancel them individually.
     
*   Event-Loop allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks by 
    offloading them to the browser or runtime environment and then executing them when the call stack is empty.

Set-interval

    *   The setInterval function in JavaScript is 
        similar to setTimeout, but instead of executing a function once after a specified delay, it repeatedly executes a function at a given interval.

            const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
            console.log('Interval executed!');
            }, 1000);

        To stop the interval execution, you can use the clearInterval function and pass in the ID returned by setInterval. 

            clearInterval(intervalId);
                
        By calling clearInterval with the intervalId, the interval execution will be stopped, and the function inside setInterval will no longer be executed.

CallBack

        Callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed at a later point in time. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle the result of an asynchronous operation.

        Ex: function get2No_and_add (a, b, callback) 
            {
            console.log(a, b);
            callback(a,b);
            }
            function add2no(a, b) {
                console.log(a + b);
            }
            get2No_and_add (4, 5, add2no);

Callback Hell : It is a term used to describe the situation when code 
                becomes difficult to read and maintain due to excessive nesting of callbacks. This often occurs in asynchronous JavaScript programming, where multiple asynchronous operations are chained together using callbacks.

                    getArticles(20, (user) => {
                    console.log("Fetch articles", user);
                    getUserData(user.username, (name) => {
                        console.log(name);
                        getAddress(name, (item) => {
                        console.log(item);
                        // this goes on and on...
                        }
                    })

Pyramid of Doom: It is a term used to describe a situation in code 
                 where multiple nested callbacks or asynchronous operations create deeply indented and hard-to-read code. It often occurs when dealing with asynchronous tasks, such as making API calls or handling events.

                    console.log("Pyramid of dooooooooom!");

                    step1(function (value1) {
                        step2(function (value2) {
                            step3(function (value3) {
                                step4(function (value4) {
                                    step5(function (value5) {
                                        step6(function (value6) {
                                            step7(function (value7) {
                                                //Do something with valuE 4
                                                console.log(value7);
                                            });
                                        });
                                    });
                                });
                            });
                        });
                    });

Promises : Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the 
           eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. They provide a way to handle asynchronous code in a more structured and readable manner.

            A promise has three states:
                *   Pending: The initial state when the promise is 
                    created, and the asynchronous operation is still in progress.
                *   Fulfilled: The state when the asynchronous operation 
                    is successfully completed, and the promise is resolved with a value.
                *   Rejected: The state when the asynchronous operation 
                    encounters an error or fails, and the promise is rejected with a reason or an error object.

AJAX : AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used to 
       send and receive data from a server without reloading the entire web page. It allows you to update parts of a web page dynamically.

        We have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
            1. xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
            2. fetch API (new way of doing)
            3. axios (this is third party library)

        HTTP request is a set of "web development techniques"  using many web technologies on the "client-side " to create asynchronous web applications. 

        We don't use data in XML format anymore , We use JSON now.
